- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Trixian
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming (Fullstack developer / Dev in the making). 
I'm a rookie at so many things, yet it all feels so familiar.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for ways to start and learn more about this new new career i'm pursuing. I decided to simply start somewhere, so I recently started an official course to become a full stack developer. This will provide me a solid base to kick-start my new career path.
