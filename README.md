- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @Trixian
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in learning programming (Fullstack developer / Dev in the making). 
I'm a rookie at so many things, yet it all feels so familiar. I used to be a computer nerd when I was younger. 
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently looking for ways to start and learn more about this new new career im pursuing. I decided to simply start somewhere, so I recently started learning python and I'll see what happens.
